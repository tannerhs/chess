# My notes
# You need to create an ssh key before cloning a repository so you can access github.
# You need to include a string specifying the destination the first time you push something, like the following:  git push git@github.com:tannerhs/chess.git
# You can store multiple public ssh keys in the ~/.ssh folder.
